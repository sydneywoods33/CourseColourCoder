# Course Colour Coder

final project for CPRG 306 | Web Development 2

by Liam Woods + Sydney Woods

An app where users input course codes (e.g., "CPRG 304D"), and each course is automatically assigned a random color. The app generates a color scheme for all courses and displays them with their assigned colors.
